                        Riley has direct relationships with landlords in the best cities throughout the country. She'll
                        find you tons of options for apartments that meet your needs and wants.

                        Your conversation with Riley takes less than 5 minutes. Riley then hunts for apartments that

                    <dd>
                        The apartments available depend on our relationships with renters and landlords in each city.
                        The apartment styles include off-campus housing, urban apartments, rural homes, short-term
                        stays, and many more.

                    <dd>
                        Yes, actually! If you are moving out of your apartment soon, tell us your information in advance
                        and if you are able to refer someone for your place, you will earn a $200 rent credit!

                        around the world.

                        Riley charges landlords when someone signs a lease. Riley is free for apartment seekers.

                        No. We made Riley months ago and when we saw Miley on ProductHunt, we decided it was time to
                        make our Twitter into a website. We put up this page in a few hrs and pushed it to see if
                        there’s interest to build more!
